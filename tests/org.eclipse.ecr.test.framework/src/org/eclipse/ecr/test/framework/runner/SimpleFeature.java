/**
 * These are the states the runner goes through when using runtime feature:
 * <pre>
 * CREATE FRAMEWORK
 * new feature()        --> constructor
 * COLLECT DEFINED DEPLOYMENTS
 * feature.initialize() --> can be used to configure nuxeo home or register JNDI objects
 * START FRAMEWORK
 * feature.start()
 * CREATE INJECTOR => feature.configure() --> can be used to add guice bindings and to dynamically deploy components using the harness
 * feature.beforeRun()
 * feature.beforeMethodRun()  --> test method interceptor
 * feature.afterMethodRun()   --> test method interceptor
 * feature.afterRun() --> cleanup that require framework to be started
 * STOP FRAMEWORK
 * feature.stop()  --> destructor
 * </pre>
